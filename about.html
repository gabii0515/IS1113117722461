        <h2>Salesforce</h2>  
         Salesforce is the world's #1 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. Our cloud-based applications for sales, service, marketing, and more don't require IT experts to set up or manage - simply log in and start connecting to customers in a whole new way.

        <h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>  
         
         In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known
         as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with
         low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT 
         infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver 
         results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers
         hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

        <h2>Cloud9</h2>  
            WS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.
            It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages,
            including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don't need to install files or configure your development machine to start new
            projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected
            machine.
